Implement the CUDA program for the assignment available at http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~soumya/hp3/assignment1_0.html.



A few extra points

1. You are supposed to identify the number of elements  of the array from the incomplete grid and block dimensions of the problem.

2. Your program should be able to take as input two floating point arrays of the same size. We are going to test with only one input case. So don't keep a scanf statement for the number of test cases.

3. Your program should produce one output array (space separated floating point values upto two decimal places only)

4. We shall test with cases such that Nan values do not occur.
