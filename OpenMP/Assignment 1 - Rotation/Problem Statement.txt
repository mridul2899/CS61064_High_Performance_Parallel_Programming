Problem Definition: Given an object (consists of a number of points) in three-dimensional (3D) space, rotate it about an arbitrary vector/axis.

Input: An arbitary axis and an object with N points, where each point is having three coordinates (X,Y,Z). Both are supplied in as files from the command line.

Output: Rotate the object about the given arbitrary axis.

Implementation: OpenMP C. Your program will read number of threads from command line.

Upload: Name your program file as firstroll_secondroll.c and upload in moodle from firstroll's login. No need to upload from second roll.

Marks will be duplicated in second roll from the first roll.

Sample program execution is:

./a.out number_of_threads filename4arbitraryAxis filename4objectFile angleOFrotatoin

Assumptions:
1. Sample test sets for filename4arbitraryAxis and filename4objectFile are provided.
2. No scaling/shear is allowed during transformation. Make sure the shape of the object remains same before and after the transformation.
3. In each step apply either translation or rotation about one axis. Do not multiply the rotation/transformation matrix to reduce number of steps in execution.

Marks:
1. Input/Output:                    10
2. Test on supplied sample test set:            15
3. Test on benchmark test set:                25
4. Scalability of your program on 1, 2, 4, 8 threads:    20
5. Best computation time (in percentile):         30

All the modules must be correctly parallelized.
